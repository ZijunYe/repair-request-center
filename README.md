# Repair Request center for school residents
## Project Overview: 
As a student who has live in a university dormitory for two years, I have encountered several
issues related to living in the residence. After discussing these challenges
with my roommate, we identified a common problem: the difficulty in contacting
the school's housing service to report maintenance issues. To elaborate on why
this is a significant problem, I have highlighted the key points below:

- Limited accessibility to school housing service: Only accept phone call/ in person to make repair request.
- Inconvenience and discomfort: Student unable to select or get notified beforehand when does the maintenance staff will come.
